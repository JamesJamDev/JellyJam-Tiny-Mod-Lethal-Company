# Tiny Company 1.0.3x
A mod that adds extra challenge to Lethal Company by making the players tiny, changing how they interact with the world and enemies.

# Basic Features
- Makes the Player 1/3 of their original size
- Player stats like movement speed, jump height and reach distance have all been adjusted
- Hoarding Bugs can pick up the player for a tiny bit when colliding (Warning: they do NOT like it when they hold you and may get aggresive)
- Features to Toggle your size and player values

# Commands
- /Size
    - Toggles your size between normal and tiny
    - Only Client-Side currently
- /Speed
    - Toggles between using the Tiny values for Speed, Jump, and reach distance and the normal player ones
    - Can be used in any state, but only impacts the tiny mode
- /Stuck
    - Can only be used in the ship
    - Teleports you to the spawn point
    - Used for when you (re)spawn in and are stuck

# IMPORTANT
The mod is not optimized at all as this is the first time I've ever made a mod.

Along with that, there are some issues with players getting stuck at times but I've added a few things to hopefully help combat that.

please see the support section below if the mod is giving you any troubles


# Installation
