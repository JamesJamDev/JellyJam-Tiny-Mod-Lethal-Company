# Tiny Company PRE RELEASE SERVER SIDE 0.1
This is the pre release verison of the mod that had the players being tiny be server wide if you are the host, which was not intended

This allows you to play with your friends or others who dont have the mod.

But their values wont be adjusted to fit the small size so they will move and jump as normal (however you will have those values)

I do not reccomend using this version but I wanted to have the option to play this one if you would like


# Installation
1. Install and download BepInEx
2. Run the game once to generate BepInEx files
3. Place the DLL file inside of the BepInEx/plugins folder

Can also be installed through Thunderstore
